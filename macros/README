The macros in the maze, hanoi and urm directories can be used to test Vim for
vi compatibility.  They have been written for vi to show its unlimited
possibilities.  The life macros can be used for performance compares.

hanoi	Macros that solve the tower of hanoi problem.
life	Macros that run Conway's game of life.
maze	Macros that solve a maze (amazing!).
urm	Macros that simulate a simple computer: "Universal Register Machine"
