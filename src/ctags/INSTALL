Simple makefiles are provided for a few environments.

    Makefile.amiga	For Amiga with Manx C
    Makefile.bcc	For Borland C/C++ on MSDOS
    Makefile.djg	For the Gnu GCC (DJGPP) compiler on MSDOS
    Makefile.os2	For OS/2
    Makefile.unix	For UNIX flavors
    Makefile.w32	For Win32 with Visual C++ or Borland C++

If you are on a host which uses CR-LF newlines, you will need to make
sure that the label BINARY_OPEN_MODE is defined (this is automatically
defined when one of either MSDOS, OS2, or WIN32 is defined). This causes
the source files to be opened in binary mode ("rb"), because the fseek()
calls do not operate correctly without it.

Compile with -DINTERNAL_SORT if you desire sorted tags and/or warnings
for duplicate tags, but do not have the external programs "sort" and
"awk" available (i.e. other than UNIX). This label is automatically
defined if any of MSDOS, OS2, WIN32, or AMIGA are defined.
