# config.mk.in -- autoconf template for Vim on Unix		vim:ts=8:sw=8:
#
# DO NOT EDIT config.mk!! Do not edit config.mk.in!! Edit Makefile and run
# configure again. config.mk will be overwritten by configure. 
#
# Configure does not edit the makefile directly. This method is not the 
# standard use of GNU autoconf, but it has two advantages:
#   a) The user can override every choice made by configure.
#   b) Modifications to the makefile are not lost when configure is run.
#
# I hope this is worth being nonstandard. jw.
